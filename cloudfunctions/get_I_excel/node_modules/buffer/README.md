#### The buffer module from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), for the browser.

With [browserify](http://browserify.org), simply `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global and you will get this module.

The goal is to provide an API that is 100% identical to
[node's Buffer API](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). Read the
[official docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

## features

- Manipulate binary data like a boss, in all browsers!
- Super fast. Backed by Typed Arrays (`Uint8Array`/`ArrayBuffer`, not `Object`)
- Extremely small bundle size (**6.75KB minified + gzipped**, 51.9KB with comments)
- Excellent browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 9+, IE 11, iOS 9+, Android, etc.)
- Preserves Node API exactly, with one minor difference (see below)
- Square-bracket `buf[4]` notation works!
- Does not modify any browser prototypes or put anything on `window`
- Comprehensive test suite (including all buffer tests from node.js core)

## install

To use this module directly (without browserify), install it:

```bash
npm install buffer
```

This module was previously called **native-buffer-browserify**, but please use **buffer**
from now on.

If you do not use a bundler, you can use the [standalone script](https://bundle.run/buffer).

## usage

The module's API is identical to node's `Buffer` API. Read the
[official docs](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) for the full list of properties,
instance methods, and class methods that are supported.

As mentioned above, `require('buffer')` or use the `Buffer` global with
[browserify](http://browserify.org) and this module will automatically be included
in your bundle. Almost any npm module will work in the browser, even if it assumes that
the node `Buffer` API will be available.

To depend on this module explicitly (without browserify), require it like this:

```js
var Buffer = require('buffer/').Buffer  // note: the trailing slash is important!
```

To require this module explicitly, use `require('buffer/')` which tells the node.js module
lookup algorithm (also used by browserify) to use the **npm module** named `buffer`
instead of the **node.js core** module named `buffer`!


## how does it work?

The Buffer constructor returns instances of `Uint8Array` that have their prototype
changed to `Buffer.prototype`. Furthermore, `Buffer` is a subclass of `Uint8Array`,
so the returned instances will have all the node `Buffer` methods and the
`Uint8Array` methods. Square bracket notation works as expected -- it returns a
single octet.

The `Uint8Array` prototype remains unmodified.


## tracking the latest node api

This module tracks the Buffer API in the latest (unstable) version of node.js. The Buffer
API is considered **stable** in the
[node stability index](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index),
so it is unlikely that there will ever be breaking changes.
Nonetheless, when/if the Buffer API changes in node, this module's API will change
accordingly.

## conversion packages

### convert typed array to buffer

Use [`typedarray-to-buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedarray-to-buffer) to convert any kind of typed array to a `Buffer`. Does not perform a copy, so it's super fast.

### convert buffer to typed array

`Buffer` is a subclass of `Uint8Array` (which is a typed array). So there is no need to explicitly convert to typed array. Just use the buffer as a `Uint8Array`.

### convert blob to buffer

Use [`blob-to-buffer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blob-to-buffer) to convert a `Blob` to a `Buffer`.

### convert buffer to blob

To convert a `Buffer` to a `Blob`, use the `Blob` constructor:

```js
var blob = new Blob([ buffer ])
```

Optionally, specify a mimetype:

```js
var blob = new Blob([ buffer ], { type: 'text/html' })
```

### convert arraybuffer to buffer

To convert an `ArrayBuffer` to a `Buffer`, use the `Buffer.from` fu
